Features for v2.0
X Filters
- Implement web components
- More flexible UI
X Enhance comment blocks and/or split code into separate modules, use webpack
- Fix blinking with certain player sizes
- Add feature load from video URL
- Add feature user settings in local storage
- Create the PWA
- Implement canvas to play the video
- Implement Commands for redo and undo actions
- Download the video with the effects
- Document the app

This app's requirements are well know and quite simple, that's why creating the
technical documentation later is good as well. The process might be considered
to be iterative. I hope have free time to implement these features and release
the next version soon.
